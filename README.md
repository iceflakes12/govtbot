# üéâ Temus Avatar Hackathon

Your objective in this Hackathon is to think of amazing, unique and creative Avatar use-cases and create a user journey UI/UX client for your users to experience this *Avatar Product*.

This repository is just a working example to work with the Temus Avatar. You don't need to based your design on this repo. Try not to limit your imagination! 

Feel free to start from a fresh new repo, taking working example code from here!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. A side-by-side Avatar study agent

2. A dedicated full-screen customer service Avatar agent

3. An embeddable Avatar javascript in external websites


## üìã Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

To check if you have Node.js installed, run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```


## üöÄ How to Get Started

Run this example NextJS repository:

```bash
# Create a new .env file from the example env file
cp .env.example .env
# Update the following variables in the .env file:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER_URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WSS_SERVER_URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UNREAL_AVATAR_URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## üß† AI Model Information

This Avatar implementation is powered by **Claude Sonnet 4**, Anthropic's latest language model, providing:

- Advanced reasoning capabilities  

- Natural conversation flow

- Contextual understanding


## ü§ñ More about the Avatar SDK

‚ùóÔ∏èNote: Only 1 concurrent Avatar is available for each Group/Api Key

1. First things first, use this endpoint `{base_url}/api/conversation/available` to check if an Avatar is available (Example in `src/components/StartConversationButton/index.tsx`).

2. Use the websocket (Example in `src/components/Conversation/index.tsx`) to start a new conversation session.

    - Use the Api Key provided to your team to connect to the Temus Backend

    - Use the websocket params to customize your Avatar experience

        - startMessage: The initial welcome message that will be utter by the Avatar

        - prompt: The system prompt to customer the conversation behavior of your Avatar (I highly welcome keeping the avatar response short and responsive to encourage 2-way dialogue with the users)

        - temperature & topP (0 - 1): To help determine how creative your Avatar's response is. (A lower value (e.g. 0.3) makes the Avatar more focused and deterministic, while a higher value (e.g. 0.9) allows for more diverse and creative)

        - avatar: Select 1 out of the following 6 Avatars to use. The Avatar profiles are available in `avatars`

            - henry
            
            - jessie
            
            - kenji
            
            - kevin
            
            - martha
            
            - michelle

        - backgroundImageUrl: A publicliy accessible image url for the Avatar background

            - ‚ùóÔ∏èImportant: Please make sure that the public image is either `PNG` or `JPEG`.

        - voice: Select 1 out of the following 6 Voices to use.

            - henry
            
            - jessie
            
            - kenji
            
            - kevin
            
            - martha
            
            - michelle

3. After successfully connecting to the websocket, an `avatar_uuid` will be provided, please use this `avatar_uuid` to connect to the Avatar Video (Example in `src/components/PixelStreamingVideo/index.tsx`)

4. Try out different start message, system prompt, avatars, voices and background images in `src/config/scenarios.ts`

5. Start Building Away! üî• You can either start from strach in a new repo to craft your own unique user experience (borrowing some of the working code here) or build on top of this repo.
